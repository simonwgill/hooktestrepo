# hooktestrepo

This repo tests what data we have about how people use pull requests and what the flow is like during an integration event.

This is a change which should be automatically committed when the reviews pass.

This is a change which should not be automatically committed, because the test branch isn't protected by any rules.

It shouldn't trigger unsupported events either
